                Tan is a proud owner of the restaurant called Yummy, located in center of the city, Houston. He has been in industry for over 15 years, learning

                Tan acquired his love for cooking from a young age after discoving MasterChef. 
                His idol is Christine Ha, a blind chef who won season 3 of MasterChef. She showed him that even with a disability, anyone can still 
                cook and make delicious food. He gained more experience by helping out in the kitchen growing up, and took culinary classes in high school
                to home his skills. With all of the skills he learned throughout the years, he showed them off to find work for various restaurants to further 
                expand his knowledge of the culinary world. Eventually, in the Spring 2024, he opens a location in the University of Houston Sugarland's new cafeteria
                to spread his joy for cooking and inspire others.</q>

                Outside of cooking and managing his restaurant, Tan loves to spend his time with his friends and family. He has a strong belief in the value of family, 
                and love to cherish his time with those he loves. He also enjoy watching anime and reality shows on his free time. Badmitton is one of his favorite
                hobbies to do as well.
